# Instrument Haven - Project Fixes

## Overview of Changes

This document outlines the fixes made to resolve frontend and backend compatibility issues in the Instrument Haven project.

### Key Issues Fixed

1. **Data Structure Mismatches**
   - Frontend and backend were using inconsistent data structures for API responses
   - Added robust path handling to properly extract data from various response formats

2. **API Route Enhancements**
   - Added proper support for category products inclusion with `?include=products` parameter
   - Implemented the `getWithProductsAndSubcategories` method to fetch categories with their products

3. **Error Handling**
   - Improved error handling and user feedback on failed requests
   - Added "Try Again" functionality to reset filters and retry loading

4. **API Client Improvements**
   - Enhanced the search functionality to support both string and object formats
   - Better handling of response structures to ensure data is properly extracted

## Testing with Postman

A Postman collection has been created at `instrument-haven-backend/postman/products.json` to help test the API endpoints. To use it:

1. Import the collection into Postman
2. Set up the environment variables:
   - `baseUrl`: http://localhost:8000
   - `token`: Your authentication token (obtained after login)

3. Test the key endpoints:
   - Get All Products
   - Get Product by ID
   - Search Products
   - Filter Products by Category
   - Get Category with Products

## Frontend-Backend Integration

The main integration points between frontend and backend are:

1. **Products List**
   - Endpoint: `GET /api/v1/products`
   - Expected response format:
   ```json
   {
     "status": "success",
     "data": {
       "products": [...],
       "pagination": {...}
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Category with Products**
   - Endpoint: `GET /api/v1/categories/{id}?include=products`
   - Expected response format:
   ```json
   {
     "status": "success",
     "data": {
       "category": {
         "id": 1,
         "name": "...",
         "products": [...]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

## Configuration

1. **Backend (.env)**
   - Ensure database connection is properly configured
   - Set `APP_URL` to match your local environment

2. **Frontend (.env)**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Adjust `VITE_API_URL` and `VITE_STORAGE_URL` to match your backend

## Running the Project

1. **Backend:**
   ```
   cd instrument-haven-backend
   composer install
   php artisan serve
   ```

2. **Frontend:**
   ```
   cd instrument-haven-frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check browser console for request/response details
2. Verify API endpoints are accessible in Postman
3. Ensure backend migrations and seeders have run successfully
4. Confirm authentication is working properly for protected routes
