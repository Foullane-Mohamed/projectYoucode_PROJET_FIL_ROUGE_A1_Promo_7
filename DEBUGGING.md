# Instrument Haven - Debugging and Error Handling Guide

## Recent Fixes

This document explains the recent fixes made to resolve the "Something went wrong" error on the products page and enhances overall error handling in the application.

### Key Improvements

1. **Error Boundary Implementation**
   - Added a robust ErrorBoundary component that catches runtime errors in React components
   - Prevents the entire app from crashing when a component fails
   - Provides user-friendly error messages and recovery options

2. **Defensive Programming**
   - Enhanced the ProductList component with better state management and error handling
   - Added null/undefined checks throughout the product loading process
   - Improved the ProductCard component to handle missing or malformed data

3. **API Client Improvements**
   - Enhanced error handling in API interceptors
   - Added standardized response formats
   - Implemented better error reporting via toast notifications

4. **Debugging Utilities**
   - Added a debugging helper utility for consistent error logging
   - Implemented safe data extraction from API responses

## Testing the Changes

1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd instrument-haven-backend
   php artisan serve
   ```

2. Start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   cd instrument-haven-frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Navigate to the products page (http://localhost:5173/products)
   - The page should now load without the "Something went wrong" error
   - If there are still API issues, you should see a more informative error message

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **No Products Display**
   - Check your API endpoints in `api.js`
   - Verify the backend is running and accessible
   - Check for CORS issues in your browser's developer console

2. **API Response Format**
   - Ensure the backend returns data in the expected format
   - Check if `getWithProductsAndSubcategories` method is implemented correctly

3. **Missing Images**
   - Verify the VITE_STORAGE_URL environment variable is set correctly
   - Check if product images exist in the expected storage location

## Console Debugging

The application now outputs more detailed debug information to help diagnose issues:

1. Open your browser's developer console
2. Look for logs prefixed with `[DEBUG]` for detailed information
3. API request/response data is now logged for troubleshooting
